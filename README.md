## Hi there! I'm Emirhan 👋

💻 I'm a Software Engineer with a strong focus on **mobile app development using Flutter**.  
🌱 I’ve been developing Flutter apps for over a year and love building clean, scalable UIs.  
🎨 I also enjoy working with **Figma** to design intuitive user experiences.  
☁️ My apps often integrate with **Firebase**, using features like authentication, Firestore, and cloud storage.  
🚀 Currently, I’m exploring **backend development with Node.js** to expand into full-stack app development.

### 🎯 Goals
To build a complete **SaaS mobile product** with real-time data, subscriptions, and backend logic — all crafted from scratch.
